# Cursed
An attempt to make a terminal graphics engine

## How to run

Firstly, download all of the files

Then under the **Cursed** directory (you should be in the folder holding all the files, not `src`), open up the terminal, type `make`

Hit enter and let it compile, then after compiling, run the command `./main` to run it

You can control the red dot (this is just for demonstration on the module, i haven't have time to document this yet)
Hitting up, down, left, and right can make the red dot move resepectively.
